            <p class="donate-p">Understanding the different types of waste is essential for sustainable waste management. Proper waste management not only helps in conserving natural resources but also plays a crucial role in protecting the environment and public health.</p>
            <p class="donate-p">Waste can be categorized into various types, including biodegradable, non-biodegradable, hazardous, recyclable, and electronic waste. Each type has its own environmental impact and requires specific management strategies.</p>
            <p class="donate-p">By adopting effective waste management practices, we can reduce pollution, conserve energy, and promote recycling and reuse. Below, you will find comprehensive information on various types of waste, their environmental impact, and practical tips on how to prevent and manage them effectively.</p>

          <div class="waste-description">Biodegradable waste is organic waste that can decompose naturally over time through the action of microorganisms. This type of waste is crucial for maintaining ecological balance. Examples include food scraps, garden waste, and paper products, which can be transformed into nutrient-rich compost.</div>
          <div class="waste-details">
